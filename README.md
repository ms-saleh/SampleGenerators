# Description
This branch is a great example in using nTopCL and Describe Command line together. The code takes in a DOE table in .csv format and needs two recipe files written in Nanoscribe format.
Credentials fro both nTopology Platform and Describe should be passed in a .txt file or directly in the termainal. The MicroChannelArray.py executes a common workflow that creates the build files.

# Installation
The basic version comes wit great help video and note on how to install the package and run a sample. Otherwise, you could use python module venv and create a virtual environment based on requirements.txt file.
